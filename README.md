# JSON Viewer

This app adds a new tab on the entry aditor allowing you to visualize the JSON payload for the current entry. This object is the result of calling the Preview API on the entry.

It leverages an open source library called [react-json-view](https://github.com/mac-s-g/react-json-view) to format the JSON object in a user-friendly manner.

## Available Scripts

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
